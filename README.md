# Introduction
This is a collection of dotfiles I have created for my Wayland enviornment. It's highly **incomplete** and meant for a personal backup, if you happened to find this repo, perhaps you can use it as a starting point or examples :) <br>I really enjoy using catppuccin theme a lot, so I decided to have a similar color palette. The one I'm using is **Macchiato Peach**, it gives me a feeling of warmth.
